# Core Operations

### Task Execution and Queues
Tasker provides flexible mechanisms for submitting and executing tasks, catering to different concurrency and priority needs.

#### `NewTaskManager` Initialization
`tasker.NewTaskManager[R, E](config Config[R])` is the primary constructor. It takes a `Config` struct that dictates how the `TaskManager` behaves. The `R` generic type specifies the resource type, and `E` specifies the expected return type of your tasks.

#### Task Submission Methods

*   **`QueueTask(task func(R) (E, error)) (E, error)`**
    Adds a task to the standard queue for asynchronous execution. The call blocks until the task completes and returns its result or error. Suitable for general background processing.

*   **`QueueTaskWithPriority(task func(R) (E, error)) (E, error)`**
    Adds a task to a dedicated high-priority queue. Tasks in this queue are processed before tasks in the main queue, ensuring faster execution for critical operations. This call also blocks until completion.

*   **`QueueTaskOnce(task func(R) (E, error)) (E, error)`**
    Similar to `QueueTask`, but with an important distinction: if the task fails and `CheckHealth` indicates an unhealthy worker, this specific task will *not* be re-queued by Tasker's internal retry mechanism. Use for non-idempotent operations where "at-most-once" processing by the `TaskManager` is desired.

*   **`QueueTaskWithPriorityOnce(task func(R) (E, error)) (E, error)`**
    Combines the high-priority behavior of `QueueTaskWithPriority` with the "at-most-once" execution semantics of `QueueTaskOnce`.

*   **`RunTask(task func(R) (E, error)) (E, error)`**
    Executes a task immediately, bypassing the main and priority queues. It first attempts to acquire a resource from an internal pre-allocated pool. If no resource is immediately available in the pool, it temporarily creates a new one via your `OnCreate` function for the duration of the task. This is a synchronous call, blocking until the task finishes. Ideal for urgent, low-latency operations that should not be delayed by queuing.

#### Worker Goroutine Flow
Workers continuously monitor the `priorityQueue` and `mainQueue`. When a task is available, a worker picks it up, executes the `run` function, handles any errors, and sends the result back to the caller. If `CheckHealth` indicates an issue, the worker may be replaced, and the task potentially re-queued.

```go
// Example of task submission (from examples/intermediate/main.go)
// Queue a normal image resize task
go func() {
    result, err := manager.QueueTask(func(proc *ImageProcessor) (string, error) {
        fmt.Printf("Worker %d processing normal resize for imageA.jpg\n", proc.ID)
        time.Sleep(150 * time.Millisecond)
        // ... processing logic ...
        return "imageA_resized.jpg", nil
    })
    // Handle result/error
}()

// Queue a high-priority thumbnail generation task
go func() {
    result, err := manager.QueueTaskWithPriority(func(proc *ImageProcessor) (string, error) {
        fmt.Printf("Worker %d processing HIGH PRIORITY thumbnail for video.mp4\n", proc.ID)
        time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)
        return "video_thumbnail.jpg", nil
    })
    // Handle result/error
}()

// Run an immediate task
immediateResult, immediateErr := manager.RunTask(func(proc *ImageProcessor) (string, error) {
    fmt.Printf("IMMEDIATE Task processing fast preview with processor %d\n", proc.ID)
    time.Sleep(20 * time.Millisecond)
    return "fast_preview.jpg", nil
})
// Handle result/error
```
