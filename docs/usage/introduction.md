# Introduction

**Software Type**: API/Library (Confidence: 95%)

tasker is a Go library designed to simplify the management of asynchronous tasks that require access to potentially limited or expensive resources. It provides a highly concurrent and scalable framework for processing jobs, abstracting away the complexities of goroutine management, worker pools, resource lifecycles, and dynamic scaling.

At its core, tasker allows you to define custom "resources" (e.g., database connections, API clients, CPU/GPU compute units) and associate them with "workers." These workers pick up tasks from a queue, execute them using an available resource, and return results. The library excels in scenarios where you need to control concurrency, ensure resource availability, prioritize certain tasks, and dynamically adjust processing capacity based on demand.
