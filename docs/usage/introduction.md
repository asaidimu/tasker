# Introduction

**Software Type**: API/Library (Confidence: 95%)

Tasker is a powerful and flexible Go library designed for efficient management of concurrent tasks. It provides a highly customizable worker pool, dynamic scaling (bursting), priority queuing, and robust resource lifecycle management, making it ideal for processing background jobs, handling I/O-bound operations, or managing CPU-intensive computations with controlled concurrency.

In modern applications, efficiently managing concurrent tasks and shared resources is critical. `tasker` addresses this by providing a comprehensive solution that abstracts away the complexities of goroutine management, worker pools, and resource lifecycles. It allows developers to define tasks that operate on specific resources (e.g., database connections, external API clients, custom compute units) and then queue these tasks for execution, letting `tasker` handle the underlying concurrency, scaling, and error recovery.

This library is particularly useful for applications that:
*   Need to process a high volume of background jobs reliably.
*   Perform operations on limited or expensive shared resources.
*   Require dynamic adjustment of processing capacity based on load.
*   Demand prioritization of certain critical tasks over others.
