# Introduction

**Software Type**: API/Library (Confidence: 100%)

Tasker is a powerful and flexible Go library designed for efficient management of concurrent tasks. It provides a highly customizable worker pool, dynamic scaling (bursting), priority queuing, and robust resource lifecycle management. This makes it an ideal solution for processing background jobs, handling I/O-bound operations, or managing CPU-intensive computations with controlled concurrency. Tasker abstracts away the complexities of goroutine management, worker pools, and resource lifecycles, allowing developers to define tasks that operate on specific resources and queue them for execution while the library handles the underlying concurrency, scaling, and error recovery.
